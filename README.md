# Encrypted-Web-Chat-App
I create a simple chat application with Node.js and React, where the exchanged messages will have end-to-end encryption using secret keys.

In recent times, real-time chat applications have grown tremendously. Most organizations have adopted them for communication. For security reasons, the messages exchanged over the network must be encrypted.

If a malicious program tries to tap the messages illegally that are exchanged across a network, the intercepted message would be in an encrypted format, thus the content of the message will not be compromised.
